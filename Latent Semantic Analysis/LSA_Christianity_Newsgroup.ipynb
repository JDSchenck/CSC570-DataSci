To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper “Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,” though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.\"\n",

    "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a technique commonly used in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). As a computer scientist, when performing NLP we are concerned with studying the interactions and between computers and human language. A great portion of this field focuses on the analysis of the relationship between multiple words in a document of text containing in a collection of documents. This is known as the subfield of Natural Language Understanding and can be thought of more simply as teaching computers how to read. \n",

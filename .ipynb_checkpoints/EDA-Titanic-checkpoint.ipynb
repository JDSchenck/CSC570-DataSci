    "My name is Jason Schenck, and I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Springfield pursuing a MS CS degree with a focus mainly on data science, analytics, and artificial intelligence. This semester (Spring 2017) I was fortunate enough to gain entry to CSC570, Data Science Essentials, under the direction of Professor Mike Bernico who is an established practicing data scientist in the field. I'm very excited for the opportunity and wealth of knowledge that will surely be gained over the course of the next few months as I progress through this challenging semester!\n",

    "For my first assignment, I will be performing an exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset provided by Kaggle which contains observations of passengers who were aboard the ship at the time of sinking. Over the next 12 weeks I intend to build upon this study and construct a successful machine learning model which will be able to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive this tragedy.  "

    "\n",
    ">The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy."

The value count and distribution tell us that most people didn't survive the sinking, which is also good news since that aligns with the actual event stats. I'm going to come back to 'Survived' later on to perform more observations and calculations since this is the dependent variable that I will be trying to model. With that in mind, I'm going to find the percentage of survival overall given 891 passengers in our sample and only 342 survived and store it for future use."

From my EDA I conclude that it is a binary categorical feature. The distribution reflects approximately 38.38% of passengers in our sample survived which aligns with the historical population data of the actual event. Also, no missing values. I'll be looking more into 'Survived' again in my later section on insights/observations, for example considering the distribution of survival by gender, class, age, etc., but for now let's move on."

I'd like to know what percentage exactly of males vs females and to store that for future use in survival analysis."

I will be further analyzing this variable in relation to survivorship after EDA of the remaining variables, but I can already tell this will be interesting because it's obvious that females _probably_ had higher survival rates due to their precedence to the lifeboats, however the distribution above shows us that there were considerably more male passengers present overall."

    "It appears cabin distribution isn't very widespread amongst our 891 passengers, we see there are only 147 total unique cabins. In further analysis, this variable can really reveal a lot about our passengers if we were to use this to classify passengers in to perhaps _accommodation classes_. By looking at the data above we can probably classify passenger's 'accommodation class' in the following way based on cabin value:\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Multiple passengers sharing one cabin</b>\n",
    " * This may be able to reveal some interesting insights such as couples, families, and poverty stricken passengers. An interesting thought that comes to mind is unmarried couples! Since our data as is would not otherwise indicate a possibility of an unmarried couple, this would be a great feature to engineer for finding this out.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Multiple passengers sharing multiple cabins</b>\n",
    " * This may be able to reveal large families traveling together (for example a party of 8 may have shared 3 cabins), wealth may be a factor of influence on this one as well which could be revealed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* <b>Single passengers that occupied more than one cabin</b>\n",
    " * Now this one makes me very curious as to why. The data reveals at least a few cases where 1 passenger has the cabin attribute indicating more than one cabin value. This could be a danger zone tho, as our data set only contains 891 observations and doesn't account for every passenger. It would be possible that there are other passengers not in our dataset that may have also been sharing the same cabin values. Still worth noting and further investigating in the future.\n",

That completely explains why these two passengers are togehter here and ironically survived together. However, still not sure why the 'Embarked' value is NaN since it also states here that Icard embarked the Titanic at Southampton. I also verified Stone, and her profile does indeed also confirm that she embarked at Southampton as well. At this point, assuming 'Encyclopedia Titanica' could be agreed upon as a reliable source, I would simply suggest to just fill in those two missing data values with 'S' for them. However, I don't want to risk hindering the dataset with changes yet until we get into missing data values further so I will leave it as is for now.\n",

The ages range from 0.42 (infant) to 80 years old. Surprisingly, at least after just a quick glance visually, it doesn't seem like age is going to have a major impact on the outcome of survival in most cases. However, for the case of children this is a different story. Age will be a very important influencing factor on survival when we analyze children age 10 or under as seen on the histogram comparison. In the future there will be many more tests to apply to age, as there may very well be more influence on survival than it appears. "

    "This variable is continuous in my opinion because a value of siblings and spouses has no defined limit (although realistically would be pretty limited), however for our dataset the distribution is almost categorical in nature with a small distribution which ranges from minimum 0 to 8 max of siblings/spouses for a particular passenger. The exact mean is 0.52, however since we're dealing with 'people' here that's kind of silly to measure in that way. The mode, that is the overwhelming majority of passengers, had 0 siblings/spouses on board. Now ofcourse, this is all assuming the data is even accurate since we know that the variable has bias since some relationships were ignored in the collection process. I would be very weary of this variable, as using it in our model could potentially really throw things off. I plan to use this variable in conjunction with one or more other variables in hopes to engineer a better feature that may be more accurate and revealing. "

    "As expected very similar to 'SibSp' with small distribution. I'm again going to say this is continuous for the same reasons as SibSp, but likewise it is also very categorical-esque. The majority of passengers had 0 parents/children onboard with them. The minimum being 0 ranging to the max of 6 (1 passenger, which will be worth exploring!). The mean 0.38, again we're dealing with people tho. Standard deviation is low at 0.8. I think it will be worth further exploring 'Parch' & 'SibSp' together in hopes to engineer a new feature that may even be categorical and simple such \"family present? (yes or no)\" perhaps that just combines both the variables here. Will require much more analysis. "

    "**Summary Fare**  \n",
    "Fare is continuous and ranges from min 0 to max ~512.33. The average fare was 32.20 and these fares had a huge variance with standard deviation of 49.69. It is very important to note here that these values are in **Pounds** which will need to be taken into consideration going forward for analysis on them, as I'm not sure how that currency system worked (yet). Perhaps in further analysis I will generate a new variable for the converted value in U.S. dollars. The histogram distribution reveals that most passengers paid between 0-50 pounds for their fare. Interesting things to note here, a handful of passengers paid 0 pounds (lucky) and some unfortunate souls paid as high as over 500 pounds. The reasons behind these fare prices as it relates to the individual passenger may very well tell an interesting story that could lead to some very useful data so I'll be sure to analyze this variable further.

    "My name is Jason Schenck, and I'm currently a graduate student at the University of Illinois at Springfield pursuing a MS CS degree with a focus mainly on data science, analytics, and artificial intelligence. This semester (Spring 2017) I was fortunate enough to gain entry to CSC570, Data Science Essentials, under the direction of Professor Mike Bernico who is an established practicing data scientist in the field. I'm very excited for the wealth of knowledge that will surely be gained over the course of the next few months as I progress through this course, and of course lot's of data!\n",

    "For my first assignment, I will be performing an exploratory data analysis on the dataset provided by Kaggle which contains observations of passengers who were aboard the Titanic at the time of sinking. In a long-term effort over the course of this semester I intend to build upon this study and construct a successful machine learning model which will be able to predict what sorts of people were likely to survive this tragedy.

    "\n",
    ">The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n",
    "\n",
    ">One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n",
    "\n",
    ">In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy."

    "'Survived' looks pretty good so far, as we would expect the analysis shows only two categories present 1 or 0 (survived, died), and we have no missing values which is great since it's crucial that we know for sure whether a passsenger survived or not. The value count and distribution tell us that most people didn't survive the sinking, which is also good news since that aligns with the actual event stats. I'm going to come back to 'Survived' later on to perform more observations and calculations since this is the dependent variable that I will be trying to model. With that in mind, I'm going to find the percentage of survival overall given 891 passengers in our sample and only 342 survived and store it for future use."

From my EDA I conclude that it is a binary categorical feature. The distribution reflects approximately 38.38% of passengers in our sample survived which aligns with the historical population data of the actual event. Also, no missing values. I'll be looking more into 'Survived' again in my later section on insights/observations, for example considering the distribution of survival by gender, class, age, etc., but for now let's move on."

The distribution of passengers by Pclass was a very heavy majority of 3rd class passengers, accounting for more than than 1st and 2nd class combined! Upon closer inspection, this variable appears to be one of the most important factors affecting survival outcome so far! There were only ~24% of first class passengers meanwhile a whopping ~55% of the passengers were 3rd class, however when it comes to survival outcomes ~40% of 1st class passengers survived while only ~35% of 3rd class passengers survived.
